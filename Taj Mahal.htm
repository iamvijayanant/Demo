<font size="6" color="#FFFFFF">Taj Mahal, the pinnacle of Mughal architecture, 
was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658), grandson of Akbar the 
great, in the memory of his queen Arjumand Bano Begum, entitled ‘Mumtaz Mahal’. 
Mumtaz Mahal was a niece of empress Nur Jahan and granddaughter of Mirza Ghias 
Beg I’timad-ud-Daula, wazir of emperor Jehangir. She was born in 1593 and died 
in 1631, during the birth of her fourteenth child at Burhanpur. Her mortal 
remains were temporarily buried in the Zainabad garden. Six months later, her 
body was transferred to Agra to be finally enshrined in the crypt of the main 
tomb of the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is the mausoleum of both Mumtaz Mahal and 
Shah Jahan.</font></span></p>
